# This program will find all instances of accented characters in the words and change them into an unaccented version

# initialize all alphabet letters
alphabet = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z']
# open the fivers.txt file
print (alphabet)
# read through the file and search for words that aren't composed of entirely alphabet characters. 

# add new "strange" letters to a list to be replaced in the next step below
