## Comme Wordle mais en fran√ßais
This is a conversion of a basic javascript project concept translating Wordle to French. Initially it was written in Javascript I'm now refactoring it to be on a MERN stack, with the backend being hosted on Netlify and the MongoDB database hosted on Atlas.

In the utilities folder there are scripts and text files that are the source for the 5-letter words and associated python scripts for converting them into their 5-letter equivalents.

For now I plan on using only supporting un-accented (EN) keyboards, with logic to add the correct accents after successful guesses.
