## Comme Wordle mais en fran√ßais

The first stage of this project was converting it from a simple javascript application to a full-stack implementation with the database and backend hosted in the cloud.

The first challenge was having accenated words. Included in the utilities folder there are text files with all French Words, all 5-letter French words, and then all 5-letter French words with accents removed. 

Also included are python programs that will be able to make the same changes to other languages with the same accented letters as French
